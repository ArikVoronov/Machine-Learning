# Machine-Learning Repository
Different instances of ML implementations including:

# Basic ML algorithms :

* Simple Linear Regression
* K Nearest Neightbours
* K-Means
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)


# Convolutional Neural Netowrk (ConvNet):

The network is a able to connect an indefinite number of convolutional layers (with maxpool optional) and fully connected layers.
A simple test case of digit recongnition is run (with 2000 samples, for simplicity), getting about 12% error.

# Reinforcement Learning:

* Pong - RL algorithm learning to play the classic game Pong (my version, somewhat similar to the Atari version). The algorithm uses my ConvNet code, with 2 fully connected layers.
