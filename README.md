# Machine-Learning
Different instances of ML implementations including:

Basic ML algorithms :

* Simple Linear Regression
* K Nearest Neightbours
* K-Means
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)


Convolutional Neural Netowrk (ConvNet):

The network is a able to connect an indefinite number of convolutional layers (with maxpool optional) and fully connected layers.
A simple test case of digit recongnition is run (with 2000 samples, for simplicity), getting about 12% error.
